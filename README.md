## What it does

| 項目 | 說明 |
| --- | --- |
| Universe | `data/universe/sp500.csv` from Wikipedia. Refreshed on the **first Sunday of each month** during the Sunday retrain. Default fetch = **all members + macros** (SPY, VIX, sector ETFs). |
| Train / show | Train on the full downloaded membership; dashboard cards shortlist the **100 lowest recent MAE** scores (0.4 High + 0.4 Low + 0.2 Close, ≥10 labeled days). Dollar volume is a tie-break and a display field. If recent High/Low/Close MAE cannot be scored, the shortlist falls back to dollar-volume top 100. |
| Model families | Three LightGBM quantile families on the **same** purged walk-forward folds: **shared** (panel), **sector** (one model per large GICS sector; small sectors → `Other`), **per-stock** (smaller trees; tickers with &lt; 400 train rows fall back to shared). |
| Quantiles | q10 / q50 / q90 on *returns vs prior close*, then converted to price levels. No LSTM. |
| Features | Known at prior close only: 1/5/20d returns, overnight gap, ATR, Parkinson vol, dollar-volume z-score, distance to 20/50/200 MAs, plus SPY / VIX / sector ETF. |
| Baseline | Close = prior close; High / Low = prior close ± 1×ATR. |
| Cards | Three JSON sets. **Fade to prior close:** touch predicted High/Low q50 during the next session, TP = prior close, SL = q10/q90 or 1×ATR. Range gate allows a side if the **ticker or the overall** High/Low model beats the ATR baseline — failing the *ticker* flag only labels the card, it does not flatten. **Close gate:** all three live books skip it (same as shared). High/Low fade room picks the side. **Recent Close MAE** (20 sessions, ≥10 labels) above 2.5% hard-flats the card; above 1.8% strips `high_confidence`. No chase if the session **open** is already through the trigger. The three live books are a system horse race (model + gates + execution); pick by realized equity, not MAE or headline hit rate. |
| Paper ledger | Three HK$500k fade books plus a **VOO buy-and-hold** book at the same start. Realize uses the **cards already on disk** (last night's list) against the next session; new cards written later in the same job are for the *following* session. Fills: RTH **5-minute** bars only, entry must print **before 12:30 America/New_York**; later prints, missing 5m, or an open that gaps through the trigger are misses (no daily-OHLC fallback). Flatten same day. Cards are the prior-session **dollar-volume top 100**. The UI «下一轉計劃» is the **sized book** (≤20 names in the full-S&P recent MAE top 200), not the miss list. Headline hit rate is on all directional *signals* (pre-fee, including names not sized into the book). Ledger High/Low/Close MAE$ is next-session price error, not the card recent-MAE%. VOO is bought once at the **2026-09-14 open** (whole shares, leftover cash, no fee) and marked `shares × session close + cash`. The VOO metric delta is **cumulative P&L vs HK$500k**, not a same-day change. Nightly syncs VOO even when fade realize is skipped. Pick a live system by realized equity vs VOO, not MAE. |
| Scoreboard | `scoreboard.json`: per family × High/Low/Close × fold — MAE$, MAPE, coverage (+ overall). |
| Backtest | Expanding walk-forward with a **5-session purge** between train and test. WF trade sim still uses daily OHLC fills and does not apply the paper 12:30 cutoff. |

## UI pages (zh-HK)

Streamlit radio:

1. **共用模型** — shared panel cards（無 Close 方向閘；Close MAE hard-flat 仍適用）  
2. **行業模型** — sector-family cards（無 Close 方向閘，同共用）  
3. **個股模型** — per-stock（無 Close 方向閘，同共用；薄歷史 fallback shared）  
4. **釘選對照** — pin tickers and compare the three families side by side  
5. **計分板** — fold-by-fold High/Low/Close MAE horse race  
6. **流水** — 三本模擬戶口各 HK$500,000 + VOO；5m、12:30 ET 前到價、開市穿過唔追；「下一轉計劃」= 已 sizing 名單（≤20），唔係錯過名單  

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python scripts/run_pipeline.py   # fetch (if needed) → three-family WF → cards
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Step-by-step:

```bash
python scripts/fetch.py          # full S&P + macros → data/parquet/ohlcv.parquet
python scripts/backtest.py       # three-family walk-forward + metrics + cards + scoreboard
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

`python scripts/fetch.py --full` is kept as an alias for the same full universe.

If the network blocks Yahoo/Stooq, **do not invent prices**. Drop a parquet with columns `date,ticker,open,high,low,close,adj_close,volume` at `data/parquet/ohlcv.parquet` and re-run `backtest.py`.

## Artifacts

```
data/artifacts/
  cards.json              # = cards_shared (backward compat)
  cards_shared.json
  cards_sector.json
  cards_stock.json
  ledger.json             # paper books (three families)
  recent_close_error_{shared,sector,stock}.json
  metrics.json            # primary (shared) + scoreboard_headline
  scoreboard.json         # full horse race
  per_ticker.json
  per_ticker_{shared,sector,stock}.json
  models/
    shared/*.txt
    sector/<Sector>/*.txt
    stock/<TICKER>/*.txt
```

Model dumps under `data/artifacts/models/` are **tracked** (needed for weekday nightly infer). `oos_predictions.parquet` / features / trades stay gitignored. `data/parquet/ohlcv.parquet` is force-tracked and committed only on the monthly full pull.

---

## Nightly update (GitHub Actions)

| When | What |
| --- | --- |
| 04:15 UTC / 12:15 HKT Tue–Sat | **Delta** OHLCV. If the session has &lt;90% S&P names with a real Close, **skip ledger and cards**. Otherwise: realize the **existing** cards on 5m / 12:30 ET, then infer new cards. Does **not** commit `ohlcv.parquet`. |
| 11:15 UTC / 19:15 HKT Sunday | Three-family walk-forward retrain. **First Sunday of the month:** refresh S&P list + **full** OHLCV pull and commit the single parquet (housekeep: ~12 blobs/year). Other Sundays keep delta and skip the parquet commit. |
| Actions → Nightly cards → Run workflow | Manual, optional full retrain |

The workflow file still checks out and pushes `feat/v1-dashboard`. Dashboard code already lives on `main`; until that ref is flipped, weekday card/ledger commits may not land on the deployed branch.

No market-data API key. Yahoo first, Stooq fallback.

---

## Tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q
```

Covers no-leakage feature timing, backtest helpers, sector assignment, and thin-ticker fallback to shared.

## v2 backtest snapshot (computed, not invented)

Snapshot from 2026-09-12 (not live cards). Real Yahoo/Stooq daily OHLCV: **516 symbols** (full S&P membership + macros), 473,671 rows, 2023-01-03 → 2026-09-11. Walk-forward: **7** purged folds, 220,055 OOS rows, 500 names. Three families on the same folds.

| Family | High MAE $ | Low MAE $ | Close MAE $ |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| shared | 2.43 | 2.56 | 3.26 |
| sector | 2.43 | 2.57 | 3.26 |
| stock | 2.44 | 2.57 | 3.27 |
| baseline (ATR / RW) | 4.06 | 4.21 | 3.25 |

High/Low: all three families beat the ATR baseline by a wide margin. Close remains near random-walk (shared 3.261 vs baseline 3.253). Shared is the slight High/Low winner on this run. Live top-100 cards **that day** (asof 2026-09-11): shared all 觀望; sector 17 long; stock 20 long / 1 short — a snapshot, not a live count.

## Railway

Production image serves Streamlit with precomputed JSON. Dockerfile copies the three family card files, `cards.json`, metrics, scoreboard, `per_ticker.json`, and `ledger.json`.
